Feel free to roam around these 3d model buildings.

You can also create your own buildings, by uploading a drawing, with dimensions of 100 pixels by 70 pixels for best quality.
Blue outlines in your drawings will be the tallest buildings, the others, less so.

To roam around these worlds, use the 

• Q and A keys to move forward and backward respectively

• Z and X keys to rotate the whole world

• Up, Down, Left, and Right keys to turn the world in the corresponding directions.

Please enjoy yourselves, as I did myself while I toyed with the concept ( and read about matrixes to understand a guide to making the illusion of 3d-ness).
